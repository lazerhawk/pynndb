** UNDER CONSTRUCTION **

PyNNDB is the second iteration of PyMamba, the name change reflects a conflict with another project
of the same name, and a degree of incompatibility between the API in the old and new versions. At
this time the core components of the project should be considered relatively stable (beta) and are
being used in production systems. The ORM module is experimental / alpha and has had very limited
testing, while the replication module is incomplete / experimental and still needs work.
